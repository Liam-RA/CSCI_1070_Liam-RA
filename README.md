# Week_2 quiz

I am a 1st year biochemistry major,

I am taking this class because I believe it is *useful*.

My repo (1/29/24) is filled with:
>1. A 'checkpoints' folder that contains 2 files: 'week1_TREE_QUIZ_CODE-checkpoint' & 'loops-checkpoint'

>2. several files from weeks 1 & 2, they are currently not seperated by folders but that ***will*** be fixed in the future
