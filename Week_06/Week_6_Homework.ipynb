    "Machine Learning(ML) is(broadly) a type of algorithm that makes predictions/creates an output, from within a 'black box', based on input 'features' or variables that relate to that output. Essentially ML algoriths take an input of a lot of data and finds patterns within it. There are many domains of machine learning algorithms, and they can be used in different ways for different tasks. Thought multiple types of ML algorithms can be used for the same task, usually there is a best model type for whatever the task it is being for. Machine learning can be classified into 3 main domains, with many variants within each domain. Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is the most farmiliar form of ML for most people; a dataset is stripped of a certain category of data, then the ML algorithm tries to find paterns within that dataset, and predict the outcome of the stripped part of the data. Then the ML algorithm is graded based on it's accuracy by comparing it's predictions to the correct results of the data. Unsupervised ML algorithms operate similarly* but there is no defined set of correct answers to compare the results, and the algorithm isn't looking for a specific outcome, it is just finding patterns in data. Both of these types of ML can be further broken down into 4 categories: dimentionality reduction & clustering for unsupervised learning, regression & classification for supervised learning. These categories are largely used for either discrete datasets, or continuous datasets repectively. Reinforcement learnign is something that I comparitively know very little about, but I will give a short description. Reinforcement learning algorithms generally have control over something, the algorithm then randomly tries different actions within it's control, and it is either rewarded or punished for this action. There is generally a goal with these algorithms, though generally that goal is to simply complete a task. (I think Boston Dynamics might employ this in their robots? but I'm not sure about that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of problems that you could employ a ML algorithm to solve, and they often are used by groups with lots of resources to solve probelms. Machine learning algorithms require A LOT of resurces to run, namely data. Without incrediblly large datasets, ML algorithms are limited in their capacities. If you do have a lot of data though, they are very good at a lot of things, and (witht he right knowledge and expertise) can be applied to almost any problem in which you have a lot of data."
